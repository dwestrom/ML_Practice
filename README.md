#### Summary of Findings
I looked at coupons for different restaurant types sent to driver and their acceptance rate. In particular, I looked closely at coupons for medium-priced restaurants (20-50) and looked for characteristics that resulted in higher acceptance rates.

The most impactful metric for med-priced restraurants is clearly how frequently each user visits a particular restaurant type. If they visit 1 or more times per month then they are more likely to accept (55.5%) compared to those who visit less than once per month (38.2%). The effect increases for those visiting 4-8 and greater than 8 times per month.

Another important factor is who is in the car with you. Kids have a strong negative impact, traveling with your partner has a positive one.

Send time was also important, favoring sends during the day. Morning and late night send were less likely to be accepted.
